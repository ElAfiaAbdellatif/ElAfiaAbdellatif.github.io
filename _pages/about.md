I am a Full Professor at the Higher National School of Computer Science and System Analysis (ENSIAS), holding a Ph.D. in Operational Research from the University of Sherbrooke, awarded in 1999. Currently, I serve as the Coordinator of the Artificial Intelligence Engineering Program (2IA). My research focuses on cutting-edge areas such as machine learning, online machine learning, bio-inspired learning, neural networks, and adversarial machine learning.
